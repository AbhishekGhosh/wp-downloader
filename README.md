WordPress Downloader
====================

The script's main purpose is to provide an easier way to put WordPress on your server (it doesn't configure wordpress for you). It does do a few things: it will automatically download the latest WordPress release (Zip file), then it will extract the Zip file contents (keeping the <code>wordpress</code> folder if wanted) and then it cleans up, removing the Zip file and itself.
